                            <li>Subscriptions are nonrefundable and non-transferable.</li>
                            <li>Subscriptions are valid for the term indicated on the receipt provided at the time of purchase of the subscription.</li>
                            <li>The United Wi-Fi subscription only applies to internet access on flights operated by United or United Express® that depart within the applicable subscription period and region. When using the internet on another airline, you will be subject to the other airline’s internet policies and fees.</li>
                            <li>Operating bandwidth is not guaranteed for any level of service purchased and is dependent on several factors including but not limited to the number of internet users on the aircraft and the number of aircraft in the nearby area. Satellite coverage may experience outages for reasons such as government regulations, weather and switching between satellite regions. 737 aircraft and aircraft equipped with DIRECTV® will only have satellite coverage within the continental U.S. On two-cabin regional aircraft, internet availability is limited to the continental United States and Canada.</li>
                            <li>Streaming services are not currently included in your United Wi-Fi subscription. However, for a limited time, you may have access to streaming capabilities at no additional charge on select aircraft such as the Boeing 737 MAX 9. In the future, United reserves the right to charge an additional fee for access to streaming services.</li>

                            <li>All United Wi-Fi subscription purchases are final and non-refundable. We don’t guarantee availability of Wi-Fi service onboard aircraft, therefore refunds won’t be provided for intermittent or non-functioning concerns.</li>
                            <li>Subscriptions may only be used by the subscriber on a flight and on one device at a time. Your subscription is non-transferable and it is against our policy for your subscription to be used on a flight that you are not on.</li>
                            <li>The subscriber’s MileagePlus® number must be used when signing in to the United Wi-Fi Portal on board to use the subscription.</li>
                            <li>Subscription prices are subject to change without notice.</li>
                            <li>United reserves the right to amend, cancel or modify these terms and conditions and pricing at any time without notice.</li>
                            <li>MileagePlus reserves the right to establish or change eligibility criteria for using miles to purchase Wi-Fi or a United Wi-Fi subscription. Each member must have sufficient miles in his or her MileagePlus account to complete the transaction. Your miles will be deducted at the time of purchase. In the event that miles have not properly debited from your account at the time of redemption, miles can be debited by MileagePlus at any time. Miles redemptions may only be made from a single account per transaction. You may not combine miles from two or more accounts on a single transaction. No MileagePlus award miles will be awarded in connection with any transaction made using MileagePlus miles. Miles accrued, awards, and benefits issued are subject to change and are subject to the rules of the United MileagePlus program, including without limitation the Premier® program (the “MileagePlus Program”), which are expressly incorporated herein. United may change the MileagePlus Program including, but not limited to, rules, regulations, travel awards and special offers or terminate the MileagePlus Program at any time and without notice.</li>
                            <li>Subscriptions may not be sold by anyone other than United. Any Subscriptions sold by a party other than United are void, and United reserves the right to take any or all of the following actions in connection with a third-party sale of a Subscription: 1) invalidate the Subscription; 2) assess the traveler for the actual value of the services obtained through use of the Subscription; 3) delete miles in the traveler’s MileagePlus account or take any other action permitted by the Rules for MileagePlus Program; and 4) take legal action against the traveler or third-party seller of the Subscription.</li>
