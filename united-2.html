                            <li>The United Wi-Fi subscription only applies to internet access on flights operated by United or United Express® that depart within the applicable subscription period and region. When using the internet on another airline, you will be subject to the other airline’s internet policies and fees.</li>
                            <li>Operating bandwidth is not guaranteed for any level of service purchased and is dependent on several factors including but not limited to the number of internet users on the aircraft and the number of aircraft in the nearby area. Satellite coverage may experience outages for reasons such as government regulations, weather and switching between satellite regions. 737 aircraft and aircraft equipped with DIRECTV® will only have satellite coverage within the continental U.S. On two-cabin regional aircraft, internet availability is limited to the continental United States and Canada.</li>

                            <li>All United Wi-Fi subscription purchases are final and non-refundable. We don’t guarantee availability of Wi-Fi service onboard aircraft, therefore refunds won’t be provided for intermittent or non-functioning concerns.</li>
                            <li>Subscriptions may only be used by the subscriber on a flight and on one device at a time. Your subscription is non-transferable and it is against our policy for your subscription to be used on a flight that you are not on.</li>

                            <li>Subscription prices are subject to change without notice.</li>
                            <li>United reserves the right to amend, cancel or modify these terms and conditions and pricing at any time without notice.</li>
                            <li>MileagePlus reserves the right to establish or change eligibility criteria for using miles to purchase Wi-Fi or a United Wi-Fi subscription. Each member must have sufficient miles in his or her MileagePlus account to complete the transaction. Your miles will be deducted at the time of purchase. In the event that miles have not properly debited from your account at the time of redemption, miles can be debited by MileagePlus at any time. Miles redemptions may only be made from a single account per transaction. You may not combine miles from two or more accounts on a single transaction. No MileagePlus award miles will be awarded in connection with any transaction made using MileagePlus miles. Miles accrued, awards, and benefits issued are subject to change and are subject to the rules of the United MileagePlus program, including without limitation the Premier® program (the “MileagePlus Program”), which are expressly incorporated herein.

                <p>If using an Apple device, make sure private relay is off. To disable, go to iCloud settings, and make sure private relay is set to “Off”.</p>
                <p>If you bought Wi-Fi and couldn’t use it, you can request a refund. If your Wi-Fi was provided by Intelstat or Gogo, contact them for a refund. For other providers, request a refund using our form. You can find who the Wi-Fi provider was for your flight on your Wi-Fi receipt.</p>

                <p>When launching your T-Mobile Inflight session, there is now a second layer of authentication using a One-Time PIN to make sure it's really you. A One-Time PIN will be sent via text message to the phone number you entered. Please ensure your phone is in Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi Calling is ON and try again if needed (it may take up to 2 minutes to receive the PIN in flight). Once you receive the One-Time PIN and start your T-Mobile Inflight session, your device information will be saved for your next flight on United.</p>
                <p>Start texting and browsing and enjoy your flight!</p>
